    "Now that we have analyzed and found the optimal setting for each of the OLS and RF models, the effectiveness of the models in forecasting detrended and deseasonalized energy consumption can be evaluated, where the goal is to account for all variability not explained by trend or the seasonal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS, which by design has zero bias, directly minimizes the sum of squared errors between predicted and observed values, making it sensitive to outliers. This sensitivity means that extreme values in the data can influence the regression coefficient, which could prove to be a problem with MSTL remainders due to the possibility of seasonality not being perfectly captured at all timesteps. However, its simplicity and interpretability remain as strengths, especially when dealing with linear relationships where the number of predictors is not excessively large and its sparsity on computational resources allows for higher retraining frequency, which has been proven to have significant impact on accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, RF offers robustness to outliers and the ability to model complex, non-linear relationships between larger set of variables without requiring transformation or assumption of linearity. Unlike OLS, RF introduces some bias to gain a reduction in variance, benefitting from an ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and generalizability. This trade-off is particularly beneficial in handling the volatile energy consumption time series. However, to get an efficient trade-off between bias and variance, it is crucial to tune the parameters to the time series, which is extremely computationally demanding in both time and computational power. For this research, the parameters have been tuned for one customer group and reused for all customer groups which is suboptimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models’ performance will be evaluated on their predictive accuracy and compared to a benchmark. This baseline assumes that the MSTL decomposition perfectly accounts for trend and seasonality, leaving no remainder, meaning that a naive model predicts zero for the detrended and deseasonalized time series. This comparison helps in highlighting the additional variance each model can explain, thereby demonstrating their ability to capture the nuances of energy consumption beyond what can be attributed to predictable patterns alone."
