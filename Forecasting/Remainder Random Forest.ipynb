    "When comparing the influence of training set size on forecasting models, it’s important to recognize that RF and OLS regression models have fundamentally different approaches to learning from historical data, which affects how they utilize and benefit from the size of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an OLS model, the training set size directly affects the parameter estimation. A larger training set can provide a more accurate estimation of the model’s coefficients by capturing more variability and potential patterns in the data. However, it may also incorporate more noise and older data points that could be less relevant in a timeseries, even after it has been decomposed, potentially making the model less responsive to recent trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, RF, a non-parametric, ensemble learning method, is less about estimating specific parameters and more about building a variety of decision trees to create a robust predictive model. Each tree in a RF model is constructed from a subset of the data and features, which means a larger training set can provide a richer set of sub-samples. This can lead to a more diverse and comprehensive ensemble, potentially capturing complex nonlinear relationships that a linear model like OLS may miss. However, RF models can also become more complex and computationally intensive with larger datasets, as more trees may be required to maintain model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional data in a larger training set could allow RF models to build trees that are less prone to overfitting, given their ability to leverage deeper interactions within the data. This depth of interaction is something OLS models, whit their reliance on linear relationships, cannot exploit as effectively."
